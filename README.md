# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

```pnpm

See package.json for all scripts.  

This project uses *p*npm  

# install all pkgs to node_modules
pnpm install 

# Run in dev server 
pnpm start 

# add a developer package
pnpm add -D [package name]  

# More info here https://pnpm.io/cli/add  

```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
